<h1>NTM Nathan Portfolio Website</h1>
<hr>

Hi Everyone,

This is the official repo to the **NTM Nathan Personal Website** (My Portfolio Website).

The aim of this website is to use minimal code as possible and to create some sort of awesome website. So its as simple as it is. It should be very easy to host if you decide to fork the repo and use it for your own use.

If you do plan on using this to build your own Portfolio Website or something else. Please do credit me at least. By just adding this line of Code anywhere in the html/css files:

"NTM Nathan Portfolio Website - Created by NTMNathan"

You can see a live version of the Website here:
